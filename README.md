 As a fresh starter in software development industry, I find it super helper to learn Git. And I found this incredibly helpful material online at [GitPro](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

Git has three main states that your files can reside in: modified, staged, and committed:

• Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.
